# If you want to edit this file only edit the sentence after the ":"
# Make sure the sentence always starts with a " and finishes with a "
#
# Most messages support color codes. Only the messages containing a "&" symbols are supporting the color format
# The correct color formats can be found on: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes
#
# If you see text containing characters like {0} this means a value will be placed on that location
# You can move these around or remove them but note this will impact the actual text and potentially not show the value
#
# If you are translating this file to a different language please tell me.
# Then I can add the translation into the plugin itself.
